Job description:
Java development
IVR
SIP
Sql
The client is ooking for this resource to work on two separate projects. As it relates to the Java portion. We are wanting to perform Medicare verifications via phone IVR. We want to automate this with an IVR-to-IVR solution built in-house and on-premise. The solution would use SIP protocol to establish a phone call, send DTMF tones to the various prompts, and then pass the audio via RTP to some sort of speech to text synthesizer which would ultimately end up written out to a database. It's been ideated in Java, which is why I'm asking for mjSIP/mjUA experience, but if someone has experience with these sort of protocols in a different language, that's fine too.
