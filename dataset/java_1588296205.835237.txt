Title: Java developer
Company: Acuitus
Location: Palo Alto, CA
Type: Full-Time

Roles and responsibilities
Acuitus is looking for Java developers who will participate in the development of the core platform, content, and supporting tools of our computer-based tutoring system. We have two engineering departments at Acuitus, Content Engineering and Core Engineering, and are looking to fill positions in both.
Core Engineering creates and maintains the Digital Tutor's infrastructure. Specific projects include creating and enhancing robust network applications, gathering and organizing large amounts of data collected from tutoring sessions, and designing and implementing complex user interfaces for internal tools. Core Engineers also write software to extract and classify information collected from virtual environments that is used to track student progress.
Content Engineers play a crucial role as well, working directly with subject matter experts to develop and implement highly interactive course materials, while ensuring that they remain flexible and robust. New course content is created in a proprietary language--similar to Java--that's geared toward developing instructional material. Content Engineers also develop the user-facing tools and applications that support our Digital Tutor, ranging from educational widgets that serve as teaching aids to applications designed to analyze data on student performance.
Requirements
* Substantial software programming background
* Solid understanding of core Java libraries
* Excellent interpersonal and communication skills
* Ability to thrive in an intellectually challenging, ever-changing environment
