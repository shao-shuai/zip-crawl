a.       Proficient in writing java code. We usually ask our candidates to write actual code during interview, either an algorithm or solve a generic problem.
b.       Excellent knowledge of object mapping, hibernate and Spring.
c.       Experience in simple design patterns. We usually ask our candidate to design a solution (end to end   entities, relations, domain and data models)
d.       Working experience with SQL   we don't expect expertise in stored procedures or triggers or DB optimizations, but we do expect candidates to write sql queries, design data models, understand relationship etc. This is not a nice to have thing; instead it's usually a deal breaker for us.
e.       Working experience of REST (any framework will do).
